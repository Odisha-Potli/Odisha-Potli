            All our products are artisanal and handmade/crafted by artisans from the confinement of their modest homes. Unevenness in weaves, prints, minor slubs in fabric and slight variation in color are expected outcomes of an authentic craft. These variations are typical characteristics of any hand-crafted product and should not to be considered as a damage or defect.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              OdishaPotli is a marketplace that promotes “One District One Product”. We curate some designs which are heritage linked, or showcase products that are made by weavers/artisans who do not have access to reach a larger audience. In the process we ensure to practice artisan branding and implement fair-trade practice. We also encourage our artisans/weavers to become entrepreneurs and upskill their talents while maintaining their lineage. As small businesses, they strive hard to make and sell authentic handmade products to their customers. It is difficult for them to accept returns from customers as many times the products are not returned in original condition. Sometimes the products returned are not in original condition of fineness, resulting in huge financial losses to both our organization, as well as to the artisans we work with.
